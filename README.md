# Python Flappy Bird AI

My work following Tech With Tim's Tutorial Series - Python Flappy Bird AI Tutorial (with NEAT).

Description: Learn how to program an AI to play the game of flappy bird using python and the module neat python. We will start by building a version of flappy bird using pygame and end by implementing the evolutionary neat algorithm to play the game.
